 * Most of the code in this file is for animating the transparency and color on hover
 * and click for aesthetic purposes. Full functionality can be achieved through jQuery,
 * but has been abandoned for slight performance boostage and code exercise.

 * The initializing code below only runs if there exists a "side" class in the Reddit
 * page. As a sidenote, rSCA stands for Reddit Side Class Array.
